# Job Finder API - Change History

## Initial Setup
- Created project structure
- Implemented base API with FastAPI
- Set up scraper architecture for LinkedIn, Indeed, and Glassdoor
- Implemented LLM-based job relevance filtering with OpenAI's API
- Created data models for jobs and search requests

## Environment Configuration
- Created .env file with OpenAI API key
- Added debug settings

## Scraper Troubleshooting
- Identified issues with scrapers:
  - LinkedIn scraper: Windows application error with Selenium
  - Indeed scraper: 403 Forbidden errors
  - Glassdoor scraper: Windows application error with Selenium

## Scraper Enhancement
- Modified .env to include USE_MOCK_SCRAPERS setting
- Implemented mock scrapers for testing
- Fixed real scrapers:
  - Rewrote LinkedIn scraper to use requests instead of Selenium
  - Enhanced Indeed scraper with rotating user agents to avoid 403 errors
  - Rewrote Glassdoor scraper to use requests instead of Selenium
  - Added more robust error handling in all scrapers
  - Improved URL construction for job search
  - Enhanced parsing logic to handle different DOM structures

## Documentation
- Created context.md to document project structure and implementation details
- Created history.md to track changes and development progress

## Performance Optimization (2025-04-25)
- Fixed application hanging issues on the root endpoint
- Added proper timeouts to all HTTP requests
- Optimized anti-blocking measures to avoid excessive delays
- Added health check endpoint for monitoring
- Added async startup/shutdown events to better manage resources
- Improved error handling for faster response times

## Dependency Management (2025-04-25)
- Fixed dependency installation issues with aiohttp and other packages requiring C extensions
- Added alternative installation methods for Windows environments
- Created installation scripts to handle dependencies without requiring Visual C++ build tools
- Updated requirements.txt to use binary wheels where available

## Empty Response for No Results (2025-04-26)
- Modified API to return empty response array instead of mock data when no jobs are found
- Fixed LinkedIn scraper timeout issues by optimizing HTML parsing
- Improved error handling in LinkedIn scraper to process job cards more efficiently
- Added more debug logging to track scraping progress
- Increased timeout for LinkedIn scraper as it found job cards but couldn't process them in time

## Improved Anti-Blocking for Indeed and Glassdoor (2025-04-26)
- Enhanced Indeed scraper with more advanced anti-blocking techniques
- Implemented rotating proxies support for Indeed and Glassdoor
- Added support for bypassing CAPTCHA challenges
- Improved HTTP headers to better mimic real browser behavior
- Added request throttling and randomized delays between requests
- Implemented alternative scraping approaches for Indeed
- Added fallback to Indeed's mobile site which has simpler anti-bot measures
- Enhanced logging to better diagnose scraping issues
