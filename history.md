# Job Finder API - Change History

## Initial Setup
- Created project structure
- Implemented base API with FastAPI
- Set up scraper architecture for LinkedIn, Indeed, and Glassdoor
- Implemented LLM-based job relevance filtering with OpenAI's API
- Created data models for jobs and search requests

## Environment Configuration
- Created .env file with OpenAI API key
- Added debug settings

## Scraper Troubleshooting
- Identified issues with scrapers:
  - LinkedIn scraper: Windows application error with Selenium
  - Indeed scraper: 403 Forbidden errors
  - Glassdoor scraper: Windows application error with Selenium

## Scraper Enhancement
- Modified .env to include USE_MOCK_SCRAPERS setting
- Implemented mock scrapers for testing
- Fixed real scrapers:
  - Rewrote LinkedIn scraper to use requests instead of Selenium
  - Enhanced Indeed scraper with rotating user agents to avoid 403 errors
  - Rewrote Glassdoor scraper to use requests instead of Selenium
  - Added more robust error handling in all scrapers
  - Improved URL construction for job search
  - Enhanced parsing logic to handle different DOM structures

## Documentation

## Empty Response for No Results (2025-04-26)
- Modified API to return empty response array instead of mock data when no jobs are found
- Fixed LinkedIn scraper timeout issues by optimizing HTML parsing
- Improved error handling in LinkedIn scraper to process job cards more efficiently
- Added more debug logging to track scraping progress
- Increased timeout for LinkedIn scraper as it found job cards but couldn't process them in time

## Improved Anti-Blocking for Indeed and Glassdoor (2025-04-26)
- Enhanced Indeed scraper with more advanced anti-blocking techniques

## Enhanced Scraper Robustness (2025-04-26)
- Fixed headers duplication issue in anti-blocking module
- Completely rewrote Indeed scraper with multiple fallback mechanisms:
  - Added RSS feed scraping which has fewer anti-bot protections
  - Added CloudScraper integration for bypassing Cloudflare protections
  - Improved simple requests approach with better headers
- Improved Glassdoor scraper with three distinct scraping methods:
  - Direct requests with optimized headers
  - Mobile site scraping with mobile user agent
  - JSON API-based approach
- Eliminated dependency on the shared anti-blocking session to avoid conflicts
- Each scraper now has its own independent scraping strategies
- Added more robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Fixed OpenAI API key validation issues

## Headless Browser Integration (2025-04-26)
- Implemented Playwright-based headless browser scraping for Indeed
- Added browser automation to bypass advanced anti-bot measures
- Created multiple fallback mechanisms if headless browser fails
- Improved Indeed scraping with specialized mobile API approach
- Enhanced RSS feed parser for alternative data source
- Added setup script for Playwright installation
- Introduced thread-safe browser management
- Improved error recovery with multiple scraping strategies
- Added browser fingerprinting evasion techniques
- Enhanced job extraction from varied HTML structures

## Advanced Anti-Blocking Solutions (2025-04-26)
- Fixed Playwright NotImplementedError issues in Windows environment
- Implemented country-specific domain targeting for Indeed to bypass geo-restrictions
- Added Google referrer chain method to circumvent Glassdoor blocks
- Created specialized headers that mimic real browser behavior
- Implemented slug-based URL patterns for improved Glassdoor scraping
- Added fallback keyword-based filtering when OpenAI quota is exceeded
- Enhanced error handling for all scrapers to gracefully handle 403 errors
- Added support for session cookie management to mimic logged-in users
- Implemented random delays between requests to avoid rate limiting
- Created configuration system to easily toggle between scraping approaches
- Added more robust parsing for varied HTML structures across different regions

## UI Response Improvements (2025-04-27)
- Fixed API hanging issues when clicking the execute button in the API UI
- Implemented strict timeouts for the entire search operation to prevent blocking
- Added fallback empty response mechanism when scraping takes too long
- Restructured API endpoint to isolate scraping operations from response handling
- Created separate helper functions for job searching and LLM processing
- Implemented scraper-specific timeout handling based on environment settings
- Added more robust error recovery to prevent UI from getting stuck
- Improved logging to better diagnose hanging issues
- Optimized background task scheduling to maintain responsiveness
